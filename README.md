# RaccoonMafia

**Laundry Raccoon** is my attempt at recreating a fast-paced cooperative time-management game in **Unreal Engine 5**, inspired by *Overcooked*. Players take on the role of an adorable yet hard-working raccoon running a busy laundromat. The goal is to complete customers' laundry requests before they get impatient and leave, earning as much money and reputation as possible.

##  Gameplay

- Customers will enter the laundromat and place their orders.
- Each order consists of possible laundry tasks such as:
  -  **Washing** – Put dirty clothes in the washing machine.
  -  **Drying** – Move washed clothes to the dryer.
  -  **Dyeing** – Apply the requested color to clothes.
  -  **Ironing** – Make clothes smooth and wrinkle-free.
- Players must complete the orders within a limited time to earn rewards.
- Delayed or failed orders will cause customers to leave unhappy, reducing profits.
- The difficulty increases as more customers arrive with complex requests.
